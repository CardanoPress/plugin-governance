# CardanoPress - Governance

## Summary
Allows users to be able to submit, participate and vote on governance proposals. Voting is done on-chain by submitting
transactions with metadata. Voting power is based on the amount of Non-Fungible Tokens or Fungible Tokens in a users
connected wallet. Requires parent plugin CardanoPress.

## Description
The CardanoPress Governance plugin allows projects to engage with their users by allowing them to cast votes on-chain.
For any decentralised autonomous organisation, this is a must. The Governance plugins will allow you to write and
publish proposals, allow you to set up the parameters around voting power and view historic proposals and their results.

This plugin requires the parent plugin [CardanoPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cardanopress/).

The plugin is created by the team at [PB Web Development](https://pbwebdev.com).

You can find out more information about CardanoPress and our blockchain integrations at [CardanoPress.io]
(https://cardanopress.io).

### Example Use Cases

For projects that have a fungible token, you can configure the plugin to take into account the balance of that token in
a users connected wallet. For each proposal that is listed on the website, you can define the voting power requirements
and snapshot time and date. This will allow users to move assets to their wallets in time for a voting power snapshot.

Users of the project can then case their vote but sending a transaction to their own wallet with a special unique
decimal value. This value is recorded on chain along with some corresponding metadata to help identify the proposal and
the voting decision by the wallet owner on that proposal.

The same scenario can be setup but with a non-fungible token and the amount of NFTs in a user's wallet be used as the
voting power.
