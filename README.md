# CardanoPress - Governance

Plugin that allows for proposals to be voted against with on chain voting.

Users will submit transactions to themselves based on what they which to vote on for various proposals.

Each vote is then tracked and tally for the total results for that proposal.

Governance can then be actioned.

We plan to tie these result actions in with smart contracts and related contracts to help be the foundation of DAOs.

Visit the GitHub repo for more up to date builds on our code.
